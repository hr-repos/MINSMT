\chapter{Introduction}
The emmersive checkersboard aims to create an interactive solo or group game experience. The
soluation this product aims to solve is the lack of a physical boardgame experiences when a player
has no people nearby to play with. The emmersive checkersboard will provide a physical boardgame
experience without the need for other players to be present.

\paragraph{Target audience}
The primary target for this project are boardgame enthusiasts who enjoy playing real live games but
have no one to play with in person, or want to play solo. In the past these players would need to
go to online platforms to play with strangers or AI opponents in a digital format which lacks the
emmersion of a real life game.

\paragraph{Working explanation}
The checkersboard uses a combination of sensors and actuators to detect the movement of game pieces
by the player and to move the pieces themselves when an AI component or a remote playter makes a
move. \\ The detection of game piece movement is done using hall sensors embedded in each square of
the boardgame which can detect the presence of magnets in the game pieces. \\ The movement of game
pieces is done using two stepper motors hidden under the board that can move a electromagnet on a
x- and y-axis below the board to move the pieces on top of the board.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Solo play against an AI opponent
    \item Multiplayer with two players one of which is remote
